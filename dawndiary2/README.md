# Battery of 9 EF Tasks for DAWNDIARY2
* To work on [Tatool Web](http://www.tatool-web.com/)
* Prepared for Dawn Diary 2
* By **[Wei Ming Ooi](https://github.com/weiming-smu)** and **[Nadyanna M. Majeed](https://github.com/nadyamajeed)**
* Adapted from
    * [Executive Functions Battery](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-ef-battery) (von Bastian, Souza, & Gade, 2016)
    * [Shifting Battery—Judgment—Animacy/Airworthyness](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-shifting-battery) (Mayr & Kliegl, 2000)

## Updating Tasks
1. Colour keep-track ([Github source: Executive Functions Battery](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-ef-battery))
2. Letter keep-track ([Github source: Executive Functions Battery](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-ef-battery))
3. Number keep-track ([Github source: Executive Functions Battery](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-ef-battery))

In Dawn Diary 1, intead of *updating ability*, we assessed *working memory capacity* (WMC). WMC was assessed using the operation span task, symmetry span task, and rotation span task in ePrime 3.

## Inhibiting Tasks
1. Simon ([Github source: Executive Functions Battery](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-ef-battery))
2. Flanker ([Github source: Executive Functions Battery](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-ef-battery))
3. Stroop ([Github source: Executive Functions Battery](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-ef-battery))

The three inhibiting tasks are exactly the same as those used in Dawn Diary 1.

## Shifting Tasks
1. Animacy locomotion ([Github source: Shifting Battery—Judgment—Animacy/Airworthyness](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-shifting-battery))
2. Colour shape ([Github source: Executive Functions Battery](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-ef-battery))
3. Magnitude parity ([Github source: Executive Functions Battery](https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web/tree/master/app/projects/public/uzh-ef-battery))

In Dawn Diary 1, intead of *animacy locomotion* (A/L) shifting, we assessed *animacy size* (A/S) shifting. A/S was swapped to A/L as participants had difficulty with the size trials. The A/L task in this battery was adapted from the *Shifting Battery*, with single-cue blocks added in a sandwich format to match the colour shape and magnitude parity tasks. The *magnitude parity* task instructions have also been corrected in Dawn Diary 2.
